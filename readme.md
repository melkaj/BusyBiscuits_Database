## Building the Project ##
 - Using CMake for builds. Create a builds folder at the root so that the file structure looks like the following:
 ```text
BusyBiscuits_Database
    +---src
    +---build               <------ New Folder
    +---.gitignore
    +---CMkakesList.txt
    +---readme.md
    +---run.sh
    +---build.sh
    +---buildandrun.sh
    +---LICENSE
```
 - To build the project through the terminal, stay in the root of the project and execute the build shell script as follows:
```
./build.sh
```
 - The build script moves into the build folder and exectutes the CMake file. Then executes the make files that were generated by the CMake. 
 - Then execute the run script:
```
./run.sh
```
 - The run script moves into the build folder as well and executes the main executable that should have been created from the generated make file in the previous step.
 - Another script was created to do the build and run steps together. Execute the build and run script:
```
./buildandrun.sh
```
